Deploy this example easily on [Northflank](https://www.northflank.com) by selecting the Ruby on Rails template when creating a new service.

Alternatively you can:

- Clone this repository to your Git account
- Select this repository in Northflank when creating a new service
- Wait for the app to build and visit the newly assigned URL. That's it!

#### Authorizing hosts

This application has been configured to [authorize hosts](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#actiondispatch-hostauthorization) passed via the environment variable `NF_HOSTS`. You can change this, if necessary, by manually setting the environment variable or changing `config.hosts` in the Ruby environments in `config/environments`.

### Live Demo

#### Versions

You can specify the migration version in the command with `VERSION=<your version>`, or set `VERSION` as an [environment variable](https://northflank.com/docs/v1/application/run/inject-runtime-variables).

## About Rails
[Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), or Rails, is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby under the MIT License. Rails is a modelâ€“viewâ€“controller framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages.

This example project uses Rails version 7.0.4 running on Ruby version 3.1.2.

## Quick start ðŸš€

To follow this quick start, first install [Ruby version 3.1.2](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/). You can also use [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) or [rvm](https://rvm.io/) to manage your Ruby installations (recommended).


1.  **Install Rails version 7.0.4.**

    ```shell
    gem install rails --version 7.0.4
    ```

1.  **Install packages.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and install gems with:

    ```shell
    # Install using bundle:
    bundle install
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Run the test server with rails:

    ```shell
    rails server -p 3000
    ```

    The live development website should now be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
